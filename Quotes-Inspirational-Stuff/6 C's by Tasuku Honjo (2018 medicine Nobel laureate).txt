"To carry out science, I always say to my students; if they do not have Curiosity, then they should not choose a career in science. 
There are many types of scientists. It is always important to find out what you really want to know. 
Imagine research as a journey deep into mountains to find the origin of the mysterious river. 
Sometimes on the path you may discover an interesting stone which you bring back and find it very precious upon careful examination. 
My style of doing science is to find something totally unknown, or to map a totally new route to an unknown cave from which water is coming out. 
You should keep asking what you wish to know rather than what you can do. You need to embrace Challenge and have the Courage to invest your effort and time. 
These three “C”s were the basis of my research career. 
Once you fix on a project, three more “C”s are required. 
Of course, you have to Continue your research with lots of Concentration. 
Concentration means placing research as a central activity in your life, sometimes sacrificing other important calls on your time to focus on your goal. 
To Continue and Concentrate, you may need Confidence that you can do it. Or it could be the other way around. 
Concentration and Continuation may eventually build up Confidence. The last three “C”s are as important as the first."
