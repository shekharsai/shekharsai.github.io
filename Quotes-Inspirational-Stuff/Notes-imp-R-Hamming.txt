The renowned American mathematician Richard Hamming (1915-1998), who made extensive contributions to computer engineering and telecommunications, wrote and lectured extensively about how one might proceed to achieve greatness.

Here is a brief selection:

1. Courage is [an] attribute of those who do great things. Without courage, [one] is unlikely to attack important problems with any persistence and hence not likely to do important things. Courage brings self-confidence, an essential feature of doing difficult things.
2. [S]uccessful people exhibit more activity, more energy than most people do... Great scientists have tremendous drive and hard work... This trait must be coupled with emotional commitment. Deep emotional commitment seems to be necessary for success. The reason is obvious. The emotional commitment keeps you thinking about the problem morning, noon and night, and that tends to beat out mere ability.
3. There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is the ability to tolerate ambiguity. [One must] be committed to [a] problem but have some tolerance of ambiguity.
4. [One] need[s] a vision of who [they] are, and where [their] field is going.
5. Knowledge and productivity are like compound interests.
6. While [...] learning things [one] need[s] to think about them and examine them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what [one] already know[s], [one] can later retrieve them in unusual situations.
7. The evidence is overwhelming that steps that transform a field often come from outsiders.
8. An important aspect of any problem is that you have a good attack, a good starting place, some reasonable idea of how to begin.
9. When someone's flavor of brains does not match [ours], [this] may be more reason for paying attention to them.
10. [Quoting the great French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur] "luck favors the prepared mind" (there are many variant translations of this statement, but the idea is clear)
11. Work on small problems that lead to the big ones.
12. Problems are only important if [one] has a reasonable attack on them. When [one] finds the right problem, [one should] drop everything else and go after it until it is solved.
13. [One must be] open to collaboration and inspiration from... peers.
14. Get good at selling.
15. [People] should know [their] value and also [their] weaknesses.
16. Another obvious trait of great people is that they do their work in such a fashion that others can build on top of it.
