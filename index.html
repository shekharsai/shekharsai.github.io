	  I have joined <a href="https://www.laas.fr/public/">LAAS-CNRS</a> as a researcher in human-robot interaction and (multi-robot) task planning. 
	  I am a part of the <a href="https://www.laas.fr/public/en/ris">Robotics and InteractionS</a> (RIS) research team, working with 
	  Dr. <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/rachid/drupal/node/11">Rachid Alami</a>.
	  In general, I am interested in automated planning, decision-making under uncertainty, multi-agent systems, human-robot interaction, heuristic search, reinforcement learning, robotics, and real-world applications. 
	  Apart from that, I am also interested in expanding my expertise in multi-agent planning/pathfinding problems under temporal and spatial uncertainty and their applications. 
	  <!--Currently, I am working in multi-agent planning and decision making with partial observability under uncertainty. -->
	  
	  <br>	  
	  <br>	  
	  Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow (for half a year) in The Department of Computer Science, 
	  <a href="https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/default.aspx">Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</a>, Beer-Sheva, Israel,

	  (Fellow of <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Awards/fellows-list.php">AAAI</a> and 
	  <a href="https://eurai.org/award/fellows">EurAI</a>).
	  Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from this university. 
	  I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor Brafman. 
	  The focus of my Ph.D. thesis - <i>Collaborative Multi-agent Planning with Partial Observability and Interacting Actions</i> 
	  (<a href="pages/Shashank_Shekhar_thesis_Ph.D._2021.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>) was on devising plausible frameworks and algorithms for solving collaborative multi-agent planning problems with interacting actions.
	  	  
	  <br> 
	  <br>
	  
	  I received my M.S. (<i>by research</i>) in artificial intelligence planning, heuristic search, and learning 
	  (my master's thesis - <i> Learning and strengthening meta-heuristics in plan-space planning</i> (<a href="pages/Shashank_Shekhar_thesis_M.S._(masters by research)_2016.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>))
	  from <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>,

	  Professor <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MTk=">Deepak Khemani</a>. 
	  I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) (<i>with distinction</i>) in 2011 from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi. 
	  I joined Infosys Ltd. as a software engineer after my bachelor's and later quit my job to join IITM.

	<h2><b><p style="color:#154360">Research</p></b></h2> 
	<hr style="height:3px;border-width:0;color:red;background-color:blue">
	<p align="justify">
	At present, I am working on the following topics:
	<ul>
	<li> <b> Human-Robot Interaction </b> </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> (<i>Planning with Human in The Loop & Human-Aware Task Planning</i>) 
	For a planning agent to decide to act in the presence of (or along with) humans to achieve a (shared) task, the agent needs to emulate and predict humans' possible decisions and actions. 
	Although humans are considered rational agents, an artificial agent cannot always be sure about their next move upfront, 
	so collaborating with them requires planning under uncertainty about the reactions/behaviors of the human agents and the environment. 
	In this direction: </div>
		<ul>
			<li> We focus on formalizing the HATP/EHDA framework that is still in its early stage of development, dealing with human-robot interaction/collaboration. </li> 
			<li> We are also motivated to generalize it while adapting MA-STRIPS/MA-PDDL frameworks and studying its properties. </li>
			<li> Our focus is also on defining novel relevant metrics and designing new heuristics and online algorithms for building fast, real-time systems.</li> 
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li> <b> Multi-Agent Planning </b> </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> 
	Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) under uncertainty in the collaborative setting is a notoriously difficult problem. 
	Often, they are modeled as Dec-POMDPs or its qualitative variant, QDec-POMDPs, a multi-agent contingent planning formalism.
	Solving Dec-POMDPs optimally is a combinatorially hard problem 
	(<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.27.4.819.297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEXP-hard</a>), 
	and the qualitative model is also no easier in the worst-case but it scales better due to its non-probabilistic structure, at least when the actions are deterministic. 
	The state-of-the-art QDec-POMDP algorithms, QDec-FP/S (presented at ICAPS'19 & AAAI'21, respectively), are based on factored planning (developed originally for classical planning) and scale much better than the recently proposed Iterative MAP algorithm. 
	We focus on enhancing the QDec-FP/S planners, enriching the existing benchmarks, and modeling a more complex class of MAP problems under partial observability and uncertainty. 
	We also focus on developing new techniques (e.g., factored planning-based approaches) for even better scalability and to push the state-of-the-art further.
