	<hr style="height:3px;border-width:0;color:red;background-color:blue">
	<p align="justify">
	At present, I am working on the following topics:	
	<li> <b>Epistemic-Doxastic Logic, Belief Revision, and Planning</b> </li>	
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> Intended towards cognitive robotic applications in human-robot interaction tasks, I am interested in planning with (higher order) false beliefs, which is challenging due to the need for belief revision.</li>
	<li> <div align="justify"> I am working on extending the Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) framework in the context of multi-agent planning. This involves the ability to reason and plan with false beliefs and interacting concurrent physical actions.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li> <b> Human-AI/Robot Collaboration </b> </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> (<i>Planning with Human in The Loop & Human-Aware Collaborative Planning</i>) For a 
		planning framework to effectively collaborate with humans in achieving a shared task, it needs to 
		anticipate and emulate humans' possible decisions, actions, and reactions to estimate their cooperation. 
		While humans are generally rational and consistent, autonomous systems cannot always predict their next 
		moves or the evolution of their mental states during task execution. 
		Therefore, planning under uncertainty about various factors—such as human reactions, behaviors, and mental 
		models—is essential. In this direction, I am focused on: </div>
		<ul>
			<li> Developing novel planning frameworks for human-aware planning in cognitive robotics, particularly for robots collaborating with humans, incorporating Theory of Mind and false beliefs.</li>
			<li> Defining new metrics, designing innovative heuristics and online algorithms for real-time systems, and conducting user studies.</li> 
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li> <b> Decision-Making Under Uncertainty in Multi-Agent and Multi-Robot Systems </b> </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> 
	Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) under uncertainty in the collaborative setting is a notoriously difficult problem. 
	Often, they are modeled as Dec-POMDPs or its qualitative variant, QDec-POMDPs, a multi-agent contingent planning formalism.
	Solving Dec-POMDPs optimally is a combinatorially hard problem 
	(<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.27.4.819.297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEXP-hard</a>), 
	and the qualitative model is also no easier in the worst-case but it scales better due to its non-probabilistic structure, at least when the actions are deterministic. 
	The state-of-the-art QDec-POMDP algorithms, QDec-FP/S (presented at ICAPS'19 & AAAI'21, respectively), are based on factored planning (developed originally for classical planning) and scale much better than the recently proposed Iterative MAP algorithm. 
	We focus on enhancing the QDec-FP/S planners, enriching the existing benchmarks, and modeling a more complex class of MAP problems under partial observability and uncertainty. 
	We also focus on developing new techniques (e.g., factored planning-based approaches) for even better scalability and to push the state-of-the-art further.
