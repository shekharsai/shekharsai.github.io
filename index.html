            <h3>Research Overview</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                <!--In real-world scenarios, relying on a single system controlled by one entity with access to all information is impractical.
				To achieve effective collaboration, it is important to balance teamwork and individual autonomy.
				My research focuses on tackling problems that require meaningful integration of perspectives, problem-solving skills, and knowledge representation and reasoning from various agents or organizations.
				I study planning and decision-making for multi-agent systems to achieve this. My goal is to tackle complex problems that extend beyond the scope of a single organization. -->
				<!--
				In real-world multi-agent systems, both fully and semi-autonomous agents must operate in dynamic, uncertain environments. Effective coordination requires balancing autonomy with collaboration, integrating diverse perspectives, and reasoning under uncertainty. My research focuses on decision-making in such settings, leveraging epistemic reasoning, human-machine interaction, and planning under uncertainty. I develop principled mathematical models and algorithms that enable agents to anticipate intent, handle false beliefs, and adapt to evolving conditions. By advancing both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations of multi-agent coordination, my work bridges the gap between abstract decision models and real-world, scalable AI solutions.
				These efforts collectively contribute to my ultimate goal: the development of trustworthy AI systems that are not only autonomous and intelligent but also reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human expectations in complex environments. -->
				In real-world multi-agent systems, effective coordination requires balancing individual autonomy with collaborative problem-solving. Entities must integrate diverse perspectives, reason under uncertainty, and adapt to dynamic environments. My research focuses on decision-making and planning for such systems, tackling challenges that arise when multiple agents or organizations with distinct knowledge and goals must work together. I develop principled mathematical models and algorithms that enable agents to anticipate intent, handle uncertainty, and reconcile differing beliefs, ensuring robust and interpretable decision-making. By bridging theoretical frameworks with practical implementations, my work advances trustworthy AI systems that are not only autonomous and intelligent but also reliable, scalable, and aligned with human expectations in complex, real-world settings.

				<p style="text-align:justify;">My research spans automated planning, decision-making under uncertainty, multi-agent systems, human-machine interaction, and heuristic search.

			<h3>Research Focus</h3>         
            <div class="research-content">
				<h4>Planning and Decision Making in Multi-Agent Systems</h4> 
				<ul>
				<li> <div> 
					<b>MAP Under Uncertainty:</b> Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) under uncertainty in the collaborative setting is a notoriously difficult problem. 
					Often, they are modeled as Dec-POMDPs or its qualitative variant, QDec-POMDPs, a multi-agent contingent planning formalism.
					Solving Dec-POMDPs optimally is a combinatorially hard problem 
					(<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.27.4.819.297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEXP-hard</a>), 
					and the qualitative model is also no easier in the worst-case but it scales better due to its non-probabilistic structure, at least when the actions are deterministic. 
					The state-of-the-art QDec-POMDP algorithms (presented at ICAPS'19 & AAAI'21, respectively), are based on factored planning (developed originally for classical planning) and scale much better than the recently proposed Iterative MAP algorithm. 
					I focus on enhancing the planners I have develpoed, enriching the existing benchmarks, and modeling a more complex class of MAP problems under partial observability and uncertainty. 
					I also focus on developing new techniques (e.g., factored planning-based approaches) for even better scalability and to push the state-of-the-art further.
				</div>
				</li>	
				<li> <div> 
					<b>Semi-Autonomous Decision Making:</b> A key aspect of my research is the development of semi-autonomous systems, where robots and humans share control and collaborate to achieve common goals. This mixed-initiative autonomy allows robots to operate independently while considering the need for human intervention or control when necessary. Additionally, I investigate how robots can adapt their planning and decision-making processes by accounting for human behaviors, expectations, and cognitive elements such as trust, theory of mind, and higher-order reasoning. This work aims to enhance the interaction and cooperation between robots and humans in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring a balanced and effective collaboration.
				</div>
				</li>
				<li> <div> 
					<b>Resilient and Adaptive Multi-Agent Pathfinding with Human Interactions:</b> My research also addresses the challenges of multi-agent pathfinding in shared spaces where robots (and also humans) coexist. The primary goal is to ensure that robots can move efficiently and safely without interfering with human activity. This includes considering how robots can adapt their behavior in environments with both autonomous and human-controlled agents, ensuring smooth interactions and preventing conflicts during navigation.
				</div>
				</li>
				</ul>  
                <h4>Epistemic-Doxastic Logic, Belief Revision, and Epistemic Planning</h4>
				<ul>
				<li> <div>
					My research focuses on epistemic-doxastic logic, which allows reasoning about knowledge and belief in multi-agent systems. In settings like robot-human interaction, agents may hold different or false beliefs, requiring belief revision to update and correct their understanding when new information is available. This is especially important when agents have higher-order beliefs about others' knowledge or intentions.
					Through epistemic-doxastic planning, I develop methods for agents to plan and reason in environments where they must account for knowledge uncertainty or false beliefs. The goal is to enable robots to make decisions and collaborate effectively, even when they do not have complete or fully accurate information.
