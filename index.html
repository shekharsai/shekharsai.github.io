	<h2><b><p style="color:#154360">Research</p></b></h2> 
	<hr style="height:3px;border-width:0;color:red;background-color:blue">
	<p align="justify">
	At present, I am working on the following topics:
	<ul>
	<li> <b> Human-AI/Robot Collaboration </b> </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> (<i>Planning with Human in The Loop & Human-Aware Collaborative Planning</i>) 
	For a (centralized/distributed) planning framework to decide to act in the presence of (or along with) humans to achieve a (shared) task, 
	it needs to estimate human cooperation by anticipating and emulating humans' possible decisions, actions, and reactions. 
	Although humans can be considered rational and congruent agents, autonomy cannot always be sure about their next 'moves' upfront, 
	as well as the evolution of their mental state as the task execution progresses.
	Hence, effectively collaborating with them requires planning under uncertainty about multiple factors like 
	the reactions or behaviors of the human agents and various mental models held by them and the environment. 
	In this direction (currently): </div>
		<ul>
			<li> We focus on formalizing the HATP/EHDA framework that is still in its early stage of development, dealing with human-robot interaction/collaboration. </li> 
			<li> We are also motivated to generalize it while adapting MA-STRIPS/MA-PDDL frameworks and studying its properties. </li>
			<li> Our focus is also on defining novel relevant metrics and designing new heuristics and online algorithms for building fast, real-time systems.</li> 
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li> <b> Multi-Agent Planning </b> </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <div align="justify"> 
	Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) under uncertainty in the collaborative setting is a notoriously difficult problem. 
	Often, they are modeled as Dec-POMDPs or its qualitative variant, QDec-POMDPs, a multi-agent contingent planning formalism.
	Solving Dec-POMDPs optimally is a combinatorially hard problem 
	(<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.27.4.819.297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEXP-hard</a>), 
	and the qualitative model is also no easier in the worst-case but it scales better due to its non-probabilistic structure, at least when the actions are deterministic. 
	The state-of-the-art QDec-POMDP algorithms, QDec-FP/S (presented at ICAPS'19 & AAAI'21, respectively), are based on factored planning (developed originally for classical planning) and scale much better than the recently proposed Iterative MAP algorithm. 
	We focus on enhancing the QDec-FP/S planners, enriching the existing benchmarks, and modeling a more complex class of MAP problems under partial observability and uncertainty. 
	We also focus on developing new techniques (e.g., factored planning-based approaches) for even better scalability and to push the state-of-the-art further.
